# Scenario - Nominal Operations

This scenario was developed to explain and demonstrate the standard (nominal) operation of a satellite in orbit, using NASA Operational Simulator for Small Satellites (NOS3).
It demonstrates the use of the ground software (GSW) and the expected return telemetry, as well as making use of flight software (FSW) and simulators.

This scenario was last updated on INSERT_DATE_HERE and leveraged the `dev` branch at the time [TIME_HERE].

## Learning Goals

By the end of this scenario, you should be able to:
 * 
 * Take a simulated pass with NOS3


## Prerequisites
