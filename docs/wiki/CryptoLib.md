# CryptoLib

CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft flight software and ground station. CryptoLib was originally designed as a Core Flight System (cFS) spacecraft library but has recently expanded in scope to become more generic and support telecommand encryption using gcrypt.
